ALX Team project on Simple shell by Benjamin Adeleye and Omoha John.

This project is about writing a shell like sh (Bourne Shell) by Stephen Bourne , in C, 
using a limited number of standard library functions, So we will use our own function that we rewrited in previous projects

The goal in this project is to enable us understand how a shell works.
